      <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you 
        will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says 
        "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at 
        reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be 
        shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure 
        to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & 
        happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.

    <p>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout its run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. 
      This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. 
      The film's storytelling is some of the best seen in blockbuster filmmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world-building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris Evans, in particular, turning in some of the most human and enduring acting performances I have ever seen. 
      In addition, Josh Brolin once again proves utterly breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and insane than he was in Infinity War. This further proves that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century.

    <p>As nature documentaries go, the modern remake of The Lion King (2019) gives some of the best a run for their money, quite literally. With a $250 million price tag, it achieves digitally what David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. 
      The result is jaw-droppingly photorealistic, but it also makes for a strange first impression. Imagine watching a Disneynature feature but with actors reading The Lion King screenplay over the top of it and the effect would be eerily similar. 
      It takes time to accept lifelike looking animals talking like cartoon characters, but the ground-breaking technical skill in which they are brought to life makes the bumpy journey worthwhile.
      Every tress of fur, crack in the arid soil and sun-swept vista is rendered in such immense detail that it's unsurprising that many people are calling this reboot live-action. It's a monumental technical achievement and the level of visual fidelity on display alone warrants seeing this film on the biggest screen possible.
